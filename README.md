Please write an app in Rails that takes in a person's height and weight and then guesses that person's gender. You will probably want to create a way to base the prediction on some sample data (don't worry too much about making the app statistically accurate.) Please also make a way to save guesses so your model and guesses can improve with use. Finally, please write some tests for your app.
